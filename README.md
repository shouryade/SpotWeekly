# SpotWeekly
Automate saving your Discover Weekly Playlist using Python.
The saved playlist link is sent to my discord server via a webhook.

Extract the ID and paste it onto the **`.env`** file.  
Fill the remaining details in the **`.env`** file.

Run `app.py` and copy the token supplied.
Run `main.py` and supply the parameters asked.  
Check Discord once `Successfully created playlist !` is printed on screen.
